	<p>It is a mighty thing to love a doctor. They usually bring you pain and bad news. Their rooms are usually cold and scary. But this docotor, our doctor, he is a force to be reckoned with. And he's awesome and loves to be loved. I am talking about The Doctor, who is an alien from Gallifrea. He's going on 1300 years old, and he's often lonely.</p>
	<p>But he has found a solution. He has found his companionsn. We all love them. Even though you might kind of hate them in the beginning, they grow on you. And it's to completely heart breaking when they die. I mean it rips our soul apart to see them leave. We grieve with him.</p>

     <h3>Top Five Episodes & Why</h3>
     <ol>
       <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1591789/?ref_=ttep_ep8">The Hungry Earth</a></li>
          <ul>
             <li>The Doctor's reaction to Amy being sucked into the earth.</li>
          
          </ul>
       <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756451/?ref_=ttep_ep8">The Idiot's Lantern</a></li>
           <ul>
             <li>The Doctor's reaction to finding Rose without a face and alone in a street.</li>
           </ul>
       <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756450/?ref_=ttep_ep14">DoomsDay</a></li>
           <ul>
             <li>We say goodbye to Rose, and the last two main scenes are very moving and emotionally charged.</li>
           </ul>
       <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1998643/?ref_=ttep_ep1">The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe</a></li>
           <ul>
             <li>The last scene, where 11 shows up at the Williams door, and they're like, we always save you a seat. He starts crying. It's so beautiful and moving.</li>
           </ul>
       <li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3469416/?ref_=ttep_ep1">Deep Breath</a></li>
          <ul>
             <li>This was masterfully done. Mofat found a way for us to still see "our" doctor in a new face. "I'm standing right in front of you. But you can't see me." I've always saw him as someone else, but not anymore.</li>

    <h3>The Actors Behind The Magic</h3>
     <p id="rose">Yes, we all know The Doctor is amaz-balls. Sometimes he's wildly sexy, other times you want to throw him out the TARDIS mid-travel. But there has to be a magic behind what we see. There are people who make The Doctor visiable to us. I'm talking about the actors!</p>
